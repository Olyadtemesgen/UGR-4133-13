                <p class="define_motherbets__About">    
                   Motherbet is a word that comes from two different language words of english (Mother) and amharic (bet) meaning house                    is famous among Addis Ababa University Students. 
                    Motherbet is Is a small kitchen like restaurant around Addis abeba university campuses 
                    and the food they make are mostly less expensive than we get in hotel and 
                    normal restaurants. It is also around the campus and 
                    it does not take that much time to buy and eat food from there.
                    Due to the above reasons students use motherbets and the business 
                    traffic and Economic benefit it has for both the students and the cooks is high.
                    There are Three renowned motherbet areas around Addis Ababa University, 
                    6 Kilo motherbets, 5 Kilo motherbets and 4 Kilo Motherbets.
                    The way we try to solve is that we make the website that try to connect the costumers(Students) and 
                    and the cook( Motherbet) owners. We can order any food we want from any mother bet we need by observing the rating 
                    given to the students and the time they need to wait to get the food(Because the website knows how many times the costumer
                    need to wait). We can ask for delivery to bring our food to wherever we need. Because the payment is online it helps to digitalize 
                    our economic culture. Motherbets can also promote their product easily and it helps students to get what they need.

                <h1>2. Motivation behind the project</h1>
                <p class="motivation__Motivation">
                    As a student of AAiT we all are a costumers of motherbets and personally 
                    I have been observing some problems around the services and stuffs like that. 
                    For example, some kitchens make good food but they do not get that much attention 
                    because there is no much awareness among the students and
                    I have observed that many students use only some of the motherbets
                    and the traffic around there is so much that we could even wait more than 1:30 hours. 
                    Due to this the quality of the product we get is usually lower and 
                    maily the precious time we waste to wait and find the best motherbet is much more irritating.
                    Due to the problems I tried to enumerate above I tried to solve using my field.
